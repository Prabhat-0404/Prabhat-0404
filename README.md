### üöÄ Featured Projects

- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline:** A complete end-to-end DevOps cycle that deploys a Django application. The project uses GitHub Actions for workflow automation, Docker for containerization, and AWS Developer Tools to build and deploy the containerized application on an EC2 instance, with real-time monitoring via Prometheus and Grafana.

- **VPC-based Web Infrastructure:** A robust infrastructure setup within a custom VPC. The frontend is hosted on Amazon S3, with a backend API on an EC2 instance that stores user data in an RDS database. The architecture is designed with security and scalability in mind, using public and private subnets.
